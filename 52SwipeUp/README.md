# 52 Swipe Up
52 Swipe Up is a puzzle mobile game created in [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) by Trollpants Game Studio in 2014.

## Open Source Release
As Trollpants is no more, I ([Jan Ivar Z. Carlsen](https://github.com/jizc)) have decided to release the game as open source. This is mainly to preserve the game, but I hope this may also help other indie devs who are just getting started.

I have rewritten parts of the source code for this release. This was both to clean it up and to get rid of some dependencies. Ads and IAPs have also been removed.

## Release History
52 Swipe Up was released on Google Play and Apple App Store on December 19th 2014 and December 22nd 2014 respectively.

## CloudOnce
[CloudOnce](https://github.com/jizc/CloudOnce) was used to implement [Google Play Game Services](https://developers.google.com/games/services/) and [Apple Game Center](https://developer.apple.com/game-center/).

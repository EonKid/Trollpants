# Bucket Knight: River Adventures
Bucket Knight: River Adventures is an endless rafting mobile game created in [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) by a team of interns at Trollpants Game Studio in 2015.

## Open Source Release
As Trollpants is no more, I ([Jan Ivar Z. Carlsen](https://github.com/jizc)) have decided to release the game as open source. This is mainly to preserve the game, but I hope this may also help other indie devs who are just getting started.

Ads have been removed, but otherwise the source is largly untouched from the original release.

## Release History
Bucket Knight: River Adventures was released on Google Play, Apple App Store and Amazon Appstore on May 13th, 2015.

## CloudOnce
[CloudOnce](https://github.com/jizc/CloudOnce) was used to implement [Google Play Game Services](https://developers.google.com/games/services/) and [Apple Game Center](https://developer.apple.com/game-center/).

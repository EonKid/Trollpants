# Trollpants Game Studio
Trollpants was an independent mobile games studio founded in Oslo, Norway on June 30th, 2014. There was 9 founding members that had all just graduated from university with various video games related bachelor's degrees. During the first year of operations, five mobile games and one Unity plugin was released. Due to financial struggles the team decided to break up in the summer of 2015. The studio continued to exist for a little over a year after that, as the Unity plugin CloudOnce was still making some money on the Unity Asset Store. The studio was fully shut down on October 19th, 2016.

To preserve the games, they have all been made open source and updated to run in Unity 2017.3. They are all avaible in this repo. Hopyfully this can also help other indie devs who are just getting started.

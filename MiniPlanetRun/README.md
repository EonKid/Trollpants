# Mini Planet Run
Mini Planet Run is an endless runner mobile game created in [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) by Trollpants Game Studio in 2015.

## Open Source Release
As Trollpants is no more, I ([Jan Ivar Z. Carlsen](https://github.com/jizc)) have decided to release the game as open source. This is mainly to preserve the game, but I hope this may also help other indie devs who are just getting started.

I have rewritten parts of the source code for this release. This was both to clean it up and to get rid of some dependencies. Ads and IAPs have also been removed.

## Release History
Mini Planet Run was released on both Google Play and Apple App Store on Febuary 18th, 2015.

## CloudOnce
[CloudOnce](https://github.com/jizc/CloudOnce) was used to implement [Google Play Game Services](https://developers.google.com/games/services/) and [Apple Game Center](https://developer.apple.com/game-center/).
